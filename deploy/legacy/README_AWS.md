# Legacy AWS Deployment Scripts

This folder contains the archived AWS deployment scripts for reference. These scripts are no longer maintained and have been replaced by GCP deployment scripts.

## Contents
- `cloud-init.sh`: AWS EC2 user-data script for provisioning.
- `ec2_launch.ps1`: PowerShell script for launching EC2 instances.
- `iam_example_policy.json`: Example IAM policy for DynamoDB access.

## Notes
- These scripts are provided as-is and may not work with the current state of the repository.
- For active deployment, use the GCP scripts in `deploy/gcp/`.
